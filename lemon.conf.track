# This is file is divided in sections, where each section    #
# is represented by a string between square brackets:        #
#                                                            #
#   [section_name]                                           #
#                                                            #
# Each section is composed by a list of elements, and each   #
# element is put in a line (is NOT possible to define more   #
# than one element per line). Each element is couple of key  #
# and value, written as following:                           #
#                                                            #
#   key = value                                              #
#                                                            #
# pay attention to the spaces before and after the equal (=) #
# character. If these spaces miss, the element will NOT be   #
# read.                                                      #
# Every element added will be ignored. It is only possible   #
# to modify the ones already present.                        #
